* Summary
  Drawing heavily on the example from [[https://github.com/sloria/flask-ghpages-example][@sloria]]
  [[https://github.com/sloria/flask-ghpages-example]], I have patched together a
  flask website to parse my CVs from org-mode (emacs+spacemacs) to markdown
  which are then translated to html. All the relevant code is in [[file:app.py]] and
  [[file:settings.py]].
* Use?
  If you think this could be useful, well, I hope it is. Here's how:
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
  virtualenv venv # Change to your preference
  source venv/bin/activate
  pip install -r requirements
  # Replace my org-mode files in 'content/' with your org-files
  python app.py
  # 'Freeze' to create a static website for Github pages
  python app.py freeze
  # Commit your changes
  git commit -a -m 'something descriptive' && git push origin
#+END_SRC

* Disclaimer
My solution to modify the base class ~FlatPages~ is very rudimentary and
simple. I am talking to the package maintainers. Stay tuned.

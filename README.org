* Overview
Drawing heavily on the example from @sloria
[[https://github.com/sloria/flask-ghpages-example]], I have patched together a
flask website to parse my CVs from org-mode (emacs+spacemacs) to markdown
which are then translated to html. All the relevant code is in [[file:app.py]] and
[[file:settings.py]].
